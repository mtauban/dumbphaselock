# dumbphaselock

This repository hosts the matlab function I used to test the efficiency of a Phase Locked Loop Alogirthm 
I implemented for some radio transmission with Arduino boards. The Matlab code modelizes the transmission 
of data, ad it computes a normalized difference between the transmitted signal and the received one.

Parameters of the function are the parameters of the transmission we want to calibrate before implementing
the algorithm in real units.
